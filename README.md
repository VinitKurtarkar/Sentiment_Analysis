Applied Pre-Processing on the data by removing special characters,punctuations and Stemming the data, also applied LabelEncoder for the Algorithms to interpret and comprehend the data in a much better way. Used CountVectorizer and Bag of Words on the data and used GaussianNB and RandomForestClassifier to see which algorithm provides better Accuracy Score.
